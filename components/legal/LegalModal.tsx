            1. Acceptance of Terms
          </h4>
          <p>
            By accessing or using the CapitalsFargoFX investment platform,
            creating an investor profile, or depositing digital cryptocurrency
            assets, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do
            not agree to these terms, you must not access or utilize the
            platform.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-sm font-bold text-slate-900">
            2. Investor Eligibility & Account Integrity
          </h4>
          <p>
            You must be at least 18 years of age or the legal age of majority in
            your jurisdiction. You agree to provide accurate, truthful, and
            complete information upon registration and maintain the security of
            your account credentials and multi-factor authentication.

            3. Investment Plans & Maturity Execution
          </h4>
          <p>
            All investment plans (including Basic, Gold, and Ultimate tiers)
            represent structured computational asset allocation agreements.
            Yields and durations are determined strictly by configured contract
            parameters. Maturity settlements are recorded irrevocably onto the
            platform&apos;s double-entry financial ledger.

            4. Deposits & Blockchain Verification
          </h4>
          <p>
            Deposits made in supported cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum,
            USDT) are held in cold-vault custodial reserves. Blockchain
            transaction hashes submitted by users require manual or automated
            node verification prior to capital deployment.
          </p>

            5. Withdrawals & Anti-Fraud Procedures
          </h4>
          <p>
            Withdrawals are processed from verified Available Balances to
            user-configured destination crypto wallets. CapitalsFargoFX reserves
            the right to conduct compliance reviews on anomalous or duplicated
            transactions.

            All user data, password hashes, and session authentication tokens

            1. Cryptocurrency Market Volatility
          </h4>
          <p>
            Digital assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are subject to
            extreme price volatility and macro market dynamics. The valuation of
            underlying crypto tokens can fluctuate rapidly due to global
            liquidity events, technological developments, and regulatory
            developments.

            2. Structured Plan Terms & Projections
          </h4>
          <p>
            Configured returns and profit percentages represent contractual
            system parameters executed through algorithmic liquidity management.
            While the platform operates with strict risk-mitigation measures and
            principal recovery protocols, digital investments inherently carry
            commercial risk.

          <h4 className="text-sm font-bold text-slate-900">
            3. Independent Financial Assessment
          </h4>
          <p>
            Investors should carefully evaluate their financial situation, risk
            tolerance, and investment objectives prior to committing funds.
            CapitalsFargoFX does not provide personalized tax or legal advice.
